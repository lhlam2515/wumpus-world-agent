        1. **Perception Phase**: 
           - Collect sensory information from environment
           - Parse percepts for breeze, stench, glitter, bump, scream

        2. **Knowledge Update Phase**:
           - Update knowledge base with new percept information
           - Apply logical inference to deduce new facts
           - Identify newly safe and dangerous cells

        3. **Goal Management Phase**:
           - Check for gold and grab if available
           - Evaluate current objectives (explore, collect gold, exit)
           - Update goal priorities based on current state

        4. **Planning Phase**:
           - Generate plans for reaching high-priority goals
           - Use A* search through known safe areas
           - Consider risk-reward tradeoffs for exploration

        5. **Action Execution Phase**:
           - Execute next planned action
           - Handle action failures and replanning
           - Update agent state based on action results

        The loop continues until one of these termination conditions:
        - Agent successfully exits with gold (victory)
        - Agent dies from pit or wumpus (failure)
        - No safe actions available (failure)
