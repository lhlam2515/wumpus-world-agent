        **Sensory Inputs Generated:**

        1. **Breeze Detection**: 
           - True if any adjacent cell (N/S/E/W) contains a pit
           - Uses Manhattan distance = 1 for adjacency
           - Walls block breeze transmission

        2. **Stench Detection**:
           - True if any adjacent cell contains a live wumpus
           - Dead wumpuses don't produce stench
           - Directional information not provided

        3. **Glitter Detection**:
           - True if current cell contains uncollected gold
           - Only detectable when agent is in same cell as gold
           - Disappears once gold is collected

        4. **Bump Feedback**:
           - True if last MOVE_FORWARD action resulted in wall collision
           - Automatically reset after being reported once
           - Helps agent maintain spatial orientation

        5. **Scream Notification**:
           - True if wumpus was killed by arrow on last turn
           - Indicates successful shot and wumpus death
           - Reset after being reported once

            Percept object containing all current sensory information.
            All boolean flags accurately reflect current world state.

        **Action Processing Details:**

        1. **MOVE_FORWARD**:

           - Update agent orientation by 90 degrees
           - No position change or hazard checks required
           - Instant action with no failure conditions

        3. **SHOOT**:
           - Fire arrow in current facing direction
           - Trace arrow path until hitting wall or wumpus
           - Kill wumpus if hit, set scream flag
           - Remove arrow from agent inventory

        4. **GRAB**:
           - Collect gold if present in current cell
           - Update agent inventory and remove gold from world
           - No effect if no gold present in current cell

           - Exit cave if agent is at starting position (0,0)
           - Raise StopIteration with success/failure status
